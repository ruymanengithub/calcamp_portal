Results from the Ground Calibration Campaign
============================================

FPA Description
---------------

The [**ALREADY DATED**] document "FM CCD Focal Plane Assignment Matrix" (`EUCL-MSS-TN-6-044, 
<../calcamp_resources/FPA/EUCL-MSS-TN-6-044_v2.0_FM_CCD_Focal_Plane_Assignment_Matrix.docx>`_  v. 2.0) provides a 
detailed description of how the blocks and their CCDs shall be arranged in the FPA, once assembled. This document 
also provides information on detector performance based on the characterisation performed by e2v-teledyne on the 
flight devices. This document is now dated, after the replacement of blocks MAX/FM10 and SKLODOWSKA/FM7 with blocks 
EINSTEIN/FM14 and OWEN/FM13, respectively. The replacements were necessary after discovery of damages to the CCD 
wirebonds in 1 CCD of each of the replaced blocks.

This **newer document**, from CEA, describes the placement of ROEs, and hardware serials (including CCD serials), at the time
of completion of assembling the 6 flight FPA slices:
`EUCL-SAP-TN-BH-0027 <../calcamp_resources/FPA/EUCL-SAP-TN-BH-0027-19_Definition_of_FM_VIS_FPA_1.0_sgnCEA.pdf>`_.

An (updated) map of the FPA to easily identify the location of the blocks is provided here,
as well. The rows ("BX") are the 6 slices or beams, each having 2 blocks with 3 CCDs. The ordering of the CCD channels (1, 2 and 3) in each block is 
indicated at the foot of the figure and is consistent for all CCDs in each column. The nick-names of the blocks match those used in the ground 
calibration campaign. The numbering of CCDs follows the FPA convention of first indicating slice number from 1 to 6, then position along the slice 
from 1 to 6 as well. The quadrants are indicated by the letters E, F, G and H, as per the CCD description.

Preliminary Results
-------------------

Some preliminary results, as reported by VIS IS at the VIS Progress Meeting held at MSSL on 18-19th September 2019
are provided here, in a set of slides. More complete and formal reporting is, of course, in progress.
