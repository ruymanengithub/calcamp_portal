DRY-RUN-0
---------

Rehearsal of the calibration campaign performed at MSSL on 5th through 9th February 2018.
Facility: CHAMBER #1.

**CAVEATS**:

* Only 1 CCD was operative during these tests (CCD2).
* The CCD was operated at higher-than-nominal temperature of 170K. This increases the dark-current levels and alters the behaviour of detector traps (release times decrease).
* Point source tests are all de-focused.
* There are substantial amounts of stray-light in most if not all tests.
* Some tests were run with wrong configurations, as indicated in the TEST-RECORD below.
* There are several features in the flat-field images (ghosts, dust diffraction features) which will be addressed in the completion of the cold commissioning of the OGSE.
